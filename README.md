# acwv-postprocessing

Implementation of a pix2pix algorithm for reducing numerical dispersion for [acwv-solver](https://github.com/antoniomedeiros1/acwv-solver) generated results. This allows using a more coarse grid, reducing the computational cost.

## Instructions

- Install [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/)

- Run `uv sync` for installing dependencies:

```
uv sync
uv venv
```

- Run cells in the `main.ipynb` notebook.
